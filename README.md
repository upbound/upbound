# Upbound issue tracking

## Overview

This repository is offered for tracking issues with the Upbound product. This repository is monitored by the Upbound product team in order to engage with our community and discuss questions and customer scenarios.

Support through issues on this repository is provided on a **best-effort basis** for issues that are reproducible outside of a control plane configuration. To receive urgent support you must file a support request through official Upbound support channels as urgent support is explicitly out of scope of this repository's objectives.

> **IMPORTANT**: For official customer support with response-time SLAs please see the [Upbound MSA](https://www.upbound.io/master-services-agreement).

Do not file issues for Crossplane providers or general Crossplane on this repository unless it is related to that feature/service and functionality with Upbound.
